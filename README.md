# Symfony Providers App

App developed using PHP Symfony 4 Framework and Tailwind CSS

Allows for:
- Connect to MySQL Database
- Read all entries
- Edit added entries
- Delete entries
- Add new entries
- Check creation time and last modified
- Responsive table - Hover over the different items to get extra info!
- Result pagination


### Docker

App can be deployed using **Docker** via

Docker setup already includes MySQL Database ready to run with the required Providers Database.

*MySQL takes longer to initialize than Symfony. Make sure to wait until MySQL image is up and running to get access to the application*
